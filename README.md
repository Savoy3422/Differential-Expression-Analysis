# Differential-Expression-Analysis
The two DESeq scripts in this project were used as training examples for differential expression analysis. Our analysis core did two types of alignment methods which needed to be processed differently. 

DESeq.R uses our in house alignment method, Pipeline_RNASeq_analysis.slm
Bluebee_DESeq2.R uses the Bluebee program alignment output.

The Word document is a training suppliment to the code that I made for our team.
